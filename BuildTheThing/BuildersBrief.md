### 1. The Builder's Brief
#https://natesnewsletter.substack.com/p/grab-the-4-prompts-i-use-to-make

**Use this when:** You have an idea for something to build but haven't started yet. This prompt forces the clarity that separates useful prototypes from abandoned experiments.

**What it produces:** A one-page brief you can reference while building, share with stakeholders, or hand to engineers later.

```jsx
I want to build something, but I need to think it through before I start. Help me create a clear brief for my prototype.

If you don't have enough information to generate useful outputs, ask me questions until you have enough information.

## WHAT I'M THINKING ABOUT BUILDING

[Describe your idea in whatever state it's in—messy is fine]

## BRIEF OUTPUT

### The Problem
What specific problem does this solve? Be concrete—not "helps with productivity" but "I waste 2 hours every week manually copying data from X to Y."

### Who It's For
- Primary user: [specific person or role]
- Their current workaround: [how they solve this today]
- Why the workaround isn't good enough: [the pain point]

### The Simplest Version
If this prototype could only do ONE thing, what would it be? Strip away every feature until you hit the core. This is what you build first.

### Success Criteria
How will you know if this works? Not "people like it" but specific signals:
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 1]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 2]
- [ ] [Measurable outcome 3]

### Must-Haves vs. Nice-to-Haves

**Must-haves (prototype is useless without these):**
- 
- 
- 

**Nice-to-haves (add if time permits):**
- 
- 
- 

**Explicitly out of scope (don't even start these):**
- 
- 

### Reality Check

Given current no-code tool limitations, this prototype:
- [ ] CAN realistically be built (single user, simple data, no complex integrations)
- [ ] CANNOT be built as described—here's what needs to change: [adjustments]

### The Build Plan

1. **First session (1-2 hours):** Build [core feature only]
2. **Second session (if needed):** Add [next priority feature]
3. **Stop when:** [specific completion criteria]

### One Sentence

This prototype lets [specific user] do [specific thing] instead of [current painful alternative].
